#  List 

# the list is mutable and can be changed and we can write multiple of thing like string, float value, int, boolean value.


# list1= [" apple ", "banana", "cherry", " ,"]

# print(list1)

# print(len(list1))

# print(list1[0])

# print(list1[1])

# print(list1[2])

# print(list1[3])

# print(list1[4]) that is going out of the range and cannot accessed


#  in case in which there are hundrads of data in which thing are difficult to find so we used a different method of _


# print(list1[-1])

# slicing in list 

# fruit_list = [ "apple", " cheery", " banana", "mango"]

# print(fruit_list[0 : ])

# print(fruit_list[-1 :]) that does not work . it is consider like we are print it from the last 

# adding new element in the list 

fruit_list = [ "apple", " cheery", " banana", "mango"]

# fruit_list.append("badam")

# print(fruit_list)
